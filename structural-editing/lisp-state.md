# Lisp State

[Lisp state](https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+spacemacs/spacemacs-evil/README.html) provides a fast and convenient way to manipulate the structure of your Clojure code whilst keeping it valid, i.e. avoiding unbalanced parenthesis.

`SPC k` opens the lisp state menu, providing commands for structural editing with Smartparens.  Any command will put the current buffer into lisp state, a transient state where you can use single character keybindings for the commands (no need to use `SPC k` each time).

Evil numeric values can be used with the Lisp state commands

`3 s` slurp three times

`w 2 s` wrap a symbol in parenthesis then slurp two times


## Common commands

| Lisp state `SPC k`    | Description                                                          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `j` /  `k`            | next close paren / previous open paren                               |
| `l` /  `h`            | next symbol / previous symbol                                        |
| `L` /  `H`            | next expression / previous expression                                |
| `s` /  `S`            | slurp forward / backward (pull in code from the right / left)        |
| `b` / `B`             | barf forward / backward (push out code to the right / left)          |
| `d s` / `d w` / `d x` | delete symbol / word / expression                                    |
| `r`                   | raise expression - replace parent expression with current expression |

This section provides further examples of the most common lisp state commands.  The [Spacemacs ABC](https://youtu.be/fYsqaAL8HSU?t=710) video also covers examples of Lisp State.

> In **lisp-state** the Spacemacs leader key, `SPC`, is not bound to the Spacemacs menu.  `M-m` can be used to open the Spacemacs menu.
